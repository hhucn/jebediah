= Jebediah - The definite guide

== The docker-compose way
You can find the `docker-compose.yml` inside the Jebediah repository.
You need to set following four environment variables:

[%header,cols="1,5,3"]
|===
|Var
|Description
|Example

|`PAGE_ACCESS_TOKEN`
| The facebook page access token of your page.
| EAAVNmfNNYB8BAMUzZCgEKnK ...

|`DBAS_URL`
| The base url of your D-BAS instance.
| https://dbas.your-domain.com, web:4284

|`DBAS_TOKEN`
| An API - access token from the admin menu of your D-BAS instance.
| f84f6:d12c1e04sdf06bd32524d ...

|`DIALOGFLOW_URL`
| The dialogflow endpoint from the facebook integration. Make sure you activated this integration!
| https://bots.dialogflow.com/facebook/<your-project-id>/webhook

|===

Then `docker-compose up`

=== Optional variables for jebediah

[%header,cols="1,5,3"]
|===
|Var
|Description
|Example

|`DIALOGFLOW_AUTH_USER`
| The facebook page access token of your page.
| EAAVNmfNNYB8BAMUzZCgEKnK ...

|`DIALOGFLOW_AUTH_PW`
| The base url of your D-BAS instance.

=== The Images
- mroerni/jebediah - The logic behind the reasoning.
- mroerni/fb-hook - for routing facebook events to either dialogflow or eauth
- mroerni/eauth - to store _D-BAS user - external user_ relations

CAUTION: Ensure that the EAUTH /store is synced with the D-BAS DB. When you delete the D-BAS DB you have to delete ./store aswell! You have to restart eauth afterwards.

== The Services
- Dialogflow-App - for the intent analyzing.
- Facebook-App - for getting the messages
- D-BAS - you know... arguments

== Start D-BAS
- Get a D-BAS instance running.
- Note the url.

== Start EAUTH
- Set `DBAS_URL` to... your DBAS_URL.
- You can set `EAUTH_STORE` if you like. Default is `./store`.
- `lein run` (Will start on port 1236)

CAUTION: Ensure that the EAUTH /store is synced with the D-BAS DB. When you delete the D-BAS DB you have to delete ./store aswell!

== Setup App
- Follow https://dialogflow.com/docs/integrations/facebook
- Note the callback URL from Dialogflow

== Start fb-hook
- set `DIALOGFLOW_URL` to the callback url from the step above. (I will be `https://bots.dialogflow.com/facebook/<dialogflow-project-id>/webhook`)
- set `EAUTH_URL` to the url of eauth *with appending `/success`!* Default is: `http://localhost:1236/success`
- `lein ring server-headless 1235`

== Start Jeb
1. Get a D-BAS instance running.
2. Set `DBAS_BASE` to your D-BAS base url. (example: `http://0.0.0.0:4284`)
3. Get a D-BAS API token and set `DBAS_TOKEN`
4. Get your Facebook page access token and set `PAGE_ACCESS_TOKEN`
